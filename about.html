        <img id="about" src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="Picture of ingredients">
        <p>After immigrating to Nevada from Phucket in 1991, Chef Thai Guy opened his flagship H-Thai-ML location in Henderson. Since then, Chef Thai Guy has expanded to three more locations throughout Nevada with great success. Many of the recipes on the menu have been passed down through his family for generations. Chef Thai learned to cook at an early age, spending many days with his Grandmother in her kitchen. Before she passed away, you could find Yai in the kitchen at H-Thai-ML often working next to her grandson, beaming with pride. Her spirit lives on in the award-winning recipes served on the menu. You will feel transported to the family's table inside Chef Thai's childhood home in Phucket every time you eat at H-Thai-ML.  </p>
